## How to get started

Prism relies on the [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react),
[prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types),
and [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)
peer-dependency packages to already be installed and set up in your project.

Install prism from the npm registry by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @ticketmaster/prism
```

Then import each component you want to use in your app:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Button } from "@ticketmaster/prism";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Button variant="standard">Hello, world!</Button>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
